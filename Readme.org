#+title: Collection of Conservation Laws Solver in 1D

This repository provides a framework for solving Conservation Law problems in 1D
with finite element and finite volume methods. Execute the program with =cls1=
(Conservation Laws Solver 1D).

The program uses =Python 3.10.6=. We suggest to use a virtual environment. The
needed packages can be installed via:

#+begin_src bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
#+end_src

After installation feel free to inspect the program by typing:

#+begin_src bash
./cls1 -h
#+end_src
