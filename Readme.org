#+title: Collection of Conservation Laws Solver in 1D

This repository provides my code for solving Conservation Law problems in 1D
with finite elements which I have written during my master thesis. Execute the
program with =cls1= (Conservation Laws Solver 1D).

To get started just type

#+begin_src bash
./cls1 -h
#+end_src

in the console.
